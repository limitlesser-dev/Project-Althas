## 🚀 **Why Project Althas?**

While reading the research paper *Absolute Zero*, I realized how **time-consuming** and **overwhelming** it can be to digest long, technical documents. That’s when I discovered the power of **AI-generated summaries**—they made the content **easy to understand** and **accessible**.

**Project Althas** is my solution to this problem:

* A **library** of AI-generated summaries for **AI research papers, open-source projects, and technical documents**.
* **Automated workflows** (using **n8n**) to streamline the summarization process.
* A **growing collection** of summaries, updated **weekly**.
