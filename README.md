## 🚀 **Why Project Althas?**
While reading the research paper *Absolute Zero*, I realized how **time-consuming** and **overwhelming** it can be to digest long, technical documents. That’s when I discovered the power of **AI-generated summaries**—they made the content **easy to understand** and **accessible**.

**Project Althas** is my solution to this problem:
- A **library** of AI-generated summaries for **AI research papers, open-source projects, and technical documents**.
- **Automated workflows** (using **n8n**) to streamline the summarization process.
- A **growing collection** of summaries, updated **weekly**.

## 📚 **What’s Inside?**
- **Summaries** of AI research papers, open-source projects, and technical documents.
- **Automation tools** to generate and update summaries efficiently.
- **Collaboration opportunities** for researchers, developers, and AI enthusiasts.
