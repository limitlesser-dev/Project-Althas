# Hi, I'm Azeem Sheikh 👋 (aka limitlesser)

🚀 I'm an aspiring developer, explorer, and endlessly curious thinker.  
My mission? To be a **Limitlesser** — someone who challenges the boundaries of the human mind and spirit.

I believe the human brain holds far more potential than we realize. Through ambitious journeys that seem unreachable or impossible, I want to **test**, **explore**, and **unlock** what’s truly possible.

I'm also deeply drawn to **creativity** — from music and visual storytelling to experimental design. I believe coding is just another form of art, and great technology should not only work — it should **feel** alive.

To me, it’s not just about building with AI — it’s about pushing both machine and mind to their full potential. I want to feel what it means to be **limitless**.
