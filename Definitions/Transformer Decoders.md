# Transformer Decoders

## Core Concept

A **Transformer Decoder** is a critical component of the [[Transformer Models|Transformer architecture]], primarily responsible for ==generating an output sequence token by token==. It typically works in conjunction with a [[Transformer Encoder|Transformer Encoder]] in sequence-to-sequence tasks (like machine translation), or it can be used as a standalone architecture (decoder-only models like [[GPT-4]]) for generative tasks. The decoder takes the encoded representation of an input sequence (from the encoder, if present) and the sequence generated so far, to predict the next token in the output.

> [!quote] In Essence
> Transformer Decoders are [[Neural Network]] modules that ==autoregressively generate output sequences== by attending to both the input context (from an encoder) and the previously generated parts of the output itself.

## In-Depth Information

### Role in Transformer Architecture

-   **Output Generation**: The primary function of the decoder is to generate the target sequence (e.g., a translated sentence, a summary, or a continuation of a prompt).
-   **Autoregressive Process**: Decoders generate sequences one token at a time. The token generated at the current step is then fed back as input for generating the next token in the subsequent step. This process typically starts with a special "start-of-sequence" (SOS) token and continues until an "end-of-sequence" (EOS) token is produced or a maximum length is reached.
-   **Contextual Understanding**: It uses attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence (from the encoder) and the already generated output sequence to predict the next token.

### Key Components of a Transformer Decoder Layer

A Transformer decoder is typically a stack of identical decoder layers. Each layer has the following main sub-components:

1.  **Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention**:
    *   **Purpose**: This allows the decoder to attend to different positions in the output sequence generated *so far*.
    *   **Masking (Look-Ahead Mask/Causal Mask)**: Crucially, a "mask" is applied to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This ensures that the prediction for the current token `i` can only depend on the known outputs before `i` and not future tokens, preserving the autoregressive property. Without this mask, the decoder could "cheat" by looking at the next token it's supposed to predict during training.
    *   **Multi-Head**: Like in the encoder, multiple attention "heads" run in parallel, allowing the model to jointly attend to information from different representational subspaces at different positions.

2.  **Encoder-Decoder Attention (Cross-Attention)**:
    *   **Purpose**: This layer allows each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the *encoder's output* (the encoded input sequence).
    *   **Mechanism**: The queries (Q) come from the output of the previous masked self-attention layer in the decoder, while the keys (K) and values (V) come from the output of the encoder stack.
    *   **Function**: This is vital for aligning the output generation with the relevant parts of the input sequence. For instance, in machine translation, it helps the decoder focus on relevant source words when generating each target word.

3.  **Feed-Forward Network (Position-wise)**:
    *   **Purpose**: This is a fully connected feed-forward network applied independently to each position.
    *   **Structure**: It usually consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU or GeLU activation function in between. This adds further non-linear processing capacity to the model.

4.  **Residual Connections and Layer Normalization**:
    *   Similar to the encoder, each sub-layer (self-attention, encoder-decoder attention, feed-forward network) has a residual connection around it, followed by layer normalization. These help in training deeper models by mitigating vanishing gradient problems and stabilizing activations.

### How Decoders Generate Sequences

1.  **Initial Input**: The process starts with a special start token (e.g., `<SOS>`) and the encoded representation of the input sequence (from the encoder, if applicable).
2.  **Embedding and Positional Encoding**: The current input token(s) to the decoder are embedded and positional encodings are added, similar to the encoder.
3.  **Decoder Layers**: The processed input passes through the stack of decoder layers.
    *   The **masked self-attention** layer processes the already generated sequence, considering its internal dependencies.
    *   The **encoder-decoder attention** layer aligns the generated sequence with the input context from the encoder.
    *   The **feed-forward network** further processes this information.
4.  **Output Prediction**: The output from the final decoder layer is passed through a linear layer (often called a classification head) and then a softmax function to produce a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary for the next token.
5.  **Token Selection**: The token with the highest probability is typically chosen as the next token in the sequence (though techniques like beam search can be used for more complex selection).
6.  **Iteration**: This newly generated token is added to the existing output sequence and becomes part of the input to the decoder in the next time step. This continues until an end-of-sequence token is generated or a predefined maximum length is reached.

### Decoder-Only Transformers

-   Architectures like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) consist only of decoder blocks.
-   In these models, the "encoder-decoder attention" component is absent. They rely solely on masked self-attention to process the input (which is typically a prompt or the beginning of a sequence) and autoregressively generate subsequent tokens.
-   These are particularly effective for text generation, language modeling, and open-ended dialogue.

### Key Differences from Transformer Encoders

| Feature                  | Transformer Encoder                                       | Transformer Decoder                                                                 |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Goal**         | Encode input sequence into a rich representation. | Generate an output sequence token by token.                                   |
| **Self-Attention**       | Unmasked (can attend to all tokens in input).       | Masked (causal, can only attend to previous tokens in output).           |
| **Additional Attention** | None                                                      | Encoder-Decoder Attention (attends to encoder output). (Not in decoder-only) |
| **Operational Mode**     | Processes entire input sequence at once.              | Autoregressive (generates output sequentially).                              |
| **Typical Use**          | Understanding tasks (classification, NER), input processing. | Generation tasks (translation, summarization, text generation). |

### Applications

Transformer decoders (either as part of an encoder-decoder setup or as decoder-only models) are fundamental to many [[State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Model|state-of-the-art]] NLP applications:
-   **[[Machine Translation]]**: Translating text from one language to another.
-   **[[Text Summarization]]**: Generating concise summaries of longer texts.
-   **[[Text Generation]]**: Creating coherent and contextually relevant text (e.g., story writing, code generation, chatbots).
-   **Language Modeling**: Predicting the next word in a sequence.
-   **[[Question Answering|Generative Question Answering]]**: Generating answers to questions.
-   **Image Captioning**: Generating textual descriptions for images (often paired with a vision encoder).
-   **[[Speech Recognition|Speech-to-Text]]**: Transcribing spoken audio into text (often paired with an audio encoder).

> [!SUMMARY] In Summary
> Transformer Decoders are powerful components designed for ==sequential output generation==. They employ a unique stack of layers, including ==masked self-attention== to handle previously generated tokens autoregressively, and often an ==encoder-decoder attention== mechanism to incorporate context from an input sequence. This architecture allows them to excel in tasks requiring the generation of coherent and contextually appropriate sequences, forming the backbone of modern generative [[AI]] and sequence-to-sequence models. Decoder-only variants have also become prominent, especially for large language models focused on text generation.
