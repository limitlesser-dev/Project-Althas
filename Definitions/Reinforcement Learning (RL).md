### Reinforcement Learning (RL): The Core Concept (Simple Version)

**Reinforcement Learning** is like teaching an AI ==**agent**== (think of it as a virtual robot or player) to make smart decisions through **trial and error**[^1][^2][^4]. The [[Agent (RL)|agent]] tries out different ==**actions**== in a specific ==**environment**== (like a game or a simulation)[^1][^3][^4]. Based on its actions, it receives ==**rewards**== (like points or treats) for good moves and possibly ==**penalties**== for bad ones[^1][^3][^5]. The agent's goal is to figure out the best strategy (called a ==**policy**==) to get the most cumulative rewards over time[^1][^3][^5][^6].

> [!quote] In Essence
> It's **learning by doing** and getting feedback (rewards/penalties) to figure out the best way to achieve a goal[^1][^6][^13].

### More Detail on Reinforcement Learning (Keeping it Simple)

> [!TIP] Analogy: Teaching a Dog "Fetch"
> Let's break down the pieces using an analogy of teaching a dog a new trick:

1.  **The [[Agent (RL)|Agent]]**: This is the learner or decision-maker[^1][^3][^4]. In our analogy, it's the ==dog==. In AI, it's the computer program or algorithm you're training[^1][^8].

2.  **The [[Environment (RL)|Environment]]**: This is the world or system the agent interacts with[^1][^2][^3][^8]. For the dog, it's the ==room or the park==. For an AI playing a game, it's the ==game itself==[^1][^8].

3.  **The [[State (RL)|State]] `(S)`**: This describes the current situation or condition the agent perceives in the environment[^1][^3][^7]. For the dog, the state could be `"ball is thrown, dog is waiting"`. For a game AI, the state could be the position of all pieces on the board or the current screen view[^9]. *Sometimes the agent only gets a partial observation of the state*[^2].

4.  **[[Action (RL)|Actions]] `(A)`**: These are the possible moves or decisions the agent can choose to make in a given state[^1][^3][^7]. The dog's possible actions might be: ==run towards the ball, ignore the ball, bark, sit==. A game AI's actions might be: ==move left, move right, jump, fire==[^9].

5.  **[[Reward (RL)|Rewards]] `(R)` (and Penalties)**: This is the ==feedback== the agent gets from the environment after taking an action in a state, indicating how good or bad that action was[^1][^2][^3][^7]. Rewards define the goal[^4][^5][^14].
    *   *Good action example*: Dog fetches ball -> ==treat (positive reward)==[^1].
    *   *Bad action example*: Dog ignores ball -> ==nothing (zero reward) or "no" (small penalty)==[^1].
    *   The agent's primary objective is to ==maximize the total or cumulative reward== over the long run (often called the *return*)[^1][^2][^3][^6][^14].

6.  **The Goal: Learn a [[Policy (RL)|Policy]] `(π)`**
    *   The agent uses the rewards and penalties from its trial-and-error experiences to learn a ==**policy**==[^1][^4][^6].
    *   A policy `π` is essentially the agent's **strategy** or **set of rules** (a mapping from states `S` to actions `A`, i.e., $π: S \rightarrow A$ or $π(a|s) = P[A_t=a|S_t=s]$ for stochastic policies) for choosing the best action to take in any given state to maximize future rewards[^1][^4][^5][^9][^14].
    *   *Example Policy*: For the dog, the learned policy would be: ==`"When I see the ball thrown (state), the best action is to run, grab it, and bring it back to get a treat (maximize reward)."`==

> [!INFO] How is RL Different from Other Learning?
> *   **Not [[Supervised Learning]]**: No labeled input-output pairs are given (e.g., "in *this* situation, do *exactly this* action"). The agent must ==discover== good actions through exploration[^3][^6][^14].
> *   **Not [[Unsupervised Learning]]**: The agent isn't just finding patterns in unlabeled data. It receives explicit ==reward signals== that guide its learning towards a specific goal[^3][^14]. It learns *what to do* based on feedback.

**Simple Examples of RL:**

*   **Game Playing:** Training AI to play games like Chess, Go, or video games (e.g., Atari, AlphaGo)[^1][^13].
*   **[[Robotics]]**: Teaching robots how to walk, grasp objects, or navigate environments[^1][^4].
*   **[[Recommendation Systems]]**: Learning what products/videos to recommend based on user interactions (clicks/purchases as rewards).
*   **Industrial Control & Optimization:** Optimizing processes in real-time (e.g., chemical plants, traffic lights)[^1].

> [!SUMMARY] In Short
> Reinforcement Learning is about an [[Agent (RL)|agent]] learning the best ==behaviour== (actions) in an [[Environment (RL)|environment]] by ==experimenting== and receiving ==feedback== in the form of [[Reward (RL)|rewards]], ultimately developing a strategy ([[Policy (RL)|policy]]) to achieve a goal by ==maximizing cumulative reward==[^1][^3][^6].

In Obsidian's *Reading View* (not Edit Mode), clicking a number like `[^1]` in the text should take you to the corresponding footnote at the bottom. The internal links like `[[Agent (RL)|Agent]]` will link to other notes in your Obsidian vault if they exist (or create placeholders if they don't). The `|Agent` part creates an alias for the link text.
