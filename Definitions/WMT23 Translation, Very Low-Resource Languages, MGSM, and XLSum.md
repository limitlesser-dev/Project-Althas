# WMT23 Translation, Very Low-Resource Languages, MGSM, and XLSum

This note covers four distinct but important areas and benchmarks in [[Natural Language Processing|Natural Language Processing (NLP)]], particularly relevant for evaluating [[Multilingual|multilingual]] capabilities and performance in challenging scenarios: **WMT23 Translation**, **Very Low-Resource Languages**, **MGSM (Multilingual Grade School Math)**, and **XLSum (Cross-lingual Summarization)**.

## WMT23 Translation

### Core Concept

**WMT23 Translation** refers to the shared tasks on machine translation (MT) held as part of the **Eighth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT23)** in 2023. WMT is an annual conference that features influential shared tasks where research groups from around the world compete to build the best MT systems for specific language pairs and conditions. These tasks serve as important benchmarks for advancing the state-of-the-art in machine translation.

> WMT23 Translation tasks are ==competitive evaluations designed to benchmark and drive progress in machine translation systems== across various language pairs and conditions, as part of the 2023 Conference on Machine Translation.

### In-Depth Information

-   **Shared Tasks**: WMT conferences typically include several shared tasks. The "News Translation Task" is often a central one, focusing on translating news articles. Other tasks might include:
    -   Biomedical translation
    -   Low-resource language translation
    -   Quality estimation for MT
    -   Automatic post-editing
    -   Terminology translation
-   **Evaluation**:
    -   Submissions are usually evaluated using a combination of automatic metrics (e.g., BLEU, COMET, chrF) and human evaluation. Human evaluation is considered the gold standard as it can assess nuances of translation quality like fluency, adequacy, and style that automatic metrics might miss.
-   **Language Pairs**: WMT tasks cover a range of language pairs, often including high-resource pairs (e.g., English-German, English-Chinese) as well as pairs involving less-resourced languages. WMT23 specifically featured news translation tasks for languages like English to/from Chinese, Czech, German, Hebrew, Hindi, Japanese, Russian, and Ukrainian, among others. There were also tasks for regional languages of India and a "general MT" task.
-   **Purpose and Significance**:
    -   **Benchmarking SOTA**: Provides a clear snapshot of the current state-of-the-art in machine translation.
    -   **Driving Innovation**: Encourages the development of new architectures, training techniques, and data augmentation methods.
    -   **Community Effort**: Fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing within the MT research community.
    -   **Focus on Challenges**: Often highlights specific challenges in MT, such as handling morphologically rich languages, low-resource scenarios, or domain adaptation.
-   **Trends in WMT23**:
    -   Continued dominance of neural machine translation (NMT) approaches, particularly those based on the [[Transformer Models|Transformer architecture]].
    -   Increasing use of large pre-trained language models, often fine-tuned for specific translation tasks.
    -   Growing interest in direct translation models for a wider variety of language pairs, rather than relying solely on pivoting through English.
    -   Emphasis on robustness and real-world applicability.

## Very Low-Resource Languages (VLLs)

### Core Concept

**Very Low-Resource Languages (VLLs)** in NLP refer to languages for which ==extremely limited digital data (text corpora, parallel data for translation, annotated datasets) is available== for training machine learning models. This scarcity poses significant challenges for developing effective NLP technologies for these languages, which are often spoken by smaller communities or have less digital presence. The threshold for "very low-resource" is not strictly defined but typically implies data amounts far smaller than what is available for "low-resource" languages, sometimes only a few thousand sentences or less of parallel data, or very small monolingual corpora.

    > Very Low-Resource Languages are those with ==exceptionally scarce digital data for NLP development==, making it extremely challenging to build high-performing AI models for them using standard techniques.

### In-Depth Information

-   **Challenges**:
    -   **Data Scarcity**: Insufficient text for training robust monolingual language models or translation models. Parallel data (aligned sentences in two languages) is particularly rare.
    -   **Lack of NLP Tools**: Often missing basic NLP tools like tokenizers, part-of-speech taggers, or named entity recognizers.
    -   **Linguistic Diversity**: VLLs can have unique linguistic features (e.g., complex morphology, different word order) not well-represented in models trained on high-resource languages.
    -   **Evaluation Difficulties**: Lack of standardized benchmarks and evaluation datasets.
    -   **Orthographic Variation**: Inconsistent spelling or writing systems can further complicate data processing.
-   **Approaches and Strategies**:
    -   **[[Transfer Learning]]**: Leveraging knowledge from high-resource languages. This can involve:
        -   **Multilingual Pre-trained Models**: Using models like mBERT, XLM-R, or newer LLMs trained on many languages and then fine-tuning them on the limited VLL data.
        -   **Cross-Lingual Embeddings**: Aligning embedding spaces of different languages.
    -   **Data Augmentation**: Creating synthetic training data (e.g., back-translation, noising).
    -   **Unsupervised and Self-Supervised Methods**: Training models on unlabeled VLL data.
    -   **Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Learning**: Designing models that can learn from very few examples or even generalize to new languages without direct training data for that specific task/language.
    -   **Active Learning**: Intelligently selecting which data to annotate to maximize model improvement with minimal labeling effort.
    -   **Community Involvement**: Working with native speaker communities to collect data and provide linguistic expertise.
    -   **Pivot-Based Translation**: Translating from a VLL to a target language via an intermediate, higher-resource language.
-   **Importance**:
    -   **Digital Inclusion**: Developing NLP for VLLs is crucial for ensuring that speakers of these languages are not left behind in the digital age.
    -   **Language Preservation**: NLP tools can aid in documenting and revitalizing endangered languages.
    -   **Access to Information**: Enabling translation and information retrieval for VLL speakers.
-   **Distinction from "Low-Resource"**: While "low-resource" also indicates data scarcity, "very low-resource" signifies an even more extreme situation, where standard low-resource techniques might still be insufficient.

## MGSM (Multilingual Grade School Math)

### Core Concept

**MGSM (Multilingual Grade School Math)** is a benchmark dataset designed to ==evaluate the mathematical reasoning capabilities of [[Large Language Models|Large Language Models (LLMs)]] across multiple languages==. It is essentially a multilingual version of the popular [[GSM8K and MATH#GSM8K (Grade School Math 8K)|GSM8K]] benchmark. MGSM consists of grade school math word problems translated into several languages, requiring models to perform multi-step arithmetic reasoning based on natural language descriptions in those languages.

> [!quote] In Essence
> MGSM is a benchmark featuring ==grade school math word problems translated into multiple languages, designed to test the multilingual mathematical reasoning skills of LLMs==.

### In-Depth Information

-   **Dataset Composition**:
    -   It typically takes problems from the English GSM8K dataset and has them translated (often by human translators or high-quality machine translation) into a diverse set of target languages.
    -   The set of languages often includes widely spoken ones (e.g., Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Hindi, Russian) and potentially some less common ones. For example, one version of MGSM includes translations into 10 diverse languages such as Bengali, German, Spanish, French, Japanese, Russian, Swahili, Tamil, Telugu, and Thai.
-   **Task**: Given a math word problem in a specific target language, the LLM must generate the correct sequence of reasoning steps (in that language or sometimes in English if specified) and the final numerical answer.
-   **Evaluation Metric**: The primary metric is **accuracy** â€“ whether the final numerical answer produced by the model matches the correct answer. The language of the generated reasoning steps might also be considered.
-   **Purpose and Significance**:
    -   **Assessing Multilingual Reasoning**: Directly evaluates whether LLMs can perform mathematical reasoning in languages other than English.
    -   **Testing Generalization**: Checks if reasoning abilities learned primarily from English data can transfer to other languages.
    -   **Identifying Language Disparities**: Can reveal performance differences across languages, highlighting potential biases or weaknesses in multilingual models.
    -   **Driving Multilingual LLM Development**: Encourages the development of LLMs that are not only multilingual in understanding and generation but also in complex reasoning tasks.
-   **Challenges for Models**:
    -   Accurately understanding the problem statement in different languages, including linguistic nuances.
    -   Performing correct multi-step arithmetic operations irrespective of the input language.
    -   Potential for translation artifacts if the dataset is created via machine translation.
    -   Generating coherent reasoning steps in the target language (if required).
-   **Performance Trends**:
    -   Models often show a performance drop when evaluated on non-English versions of math problems compared to English, even if they are multilingual.
    -   Techniques like [[Transformer Models#Novel CoT Prompting Approach|Chain-of-Thought (CoT)]] prompting, especially when demonstrated in the target language or in English, can improve performance.
    -   There's active research in improving cross-lingual transfer for reasoning tasks.

## XLSum (Cross-lingual Summarization)

### Core Concept

**XLSum (Cross-lingual Summarization)** is a large-scale benchmark dataset designed for ==evaluating abstractive text summarization models across multiple languages==. It contains articles from BBC News and their corresponding summaries, covering 44 languages. The goal is to assess how well models can generate concise and informative summaries of news articles in various languages, and also to support research in cross-lingual summarization (e.g., summarizing an article in one language into another).

> [!quote] In Essence
> XLSum is a ==large-scale multilingual dataset of news articles and their summaries across 44 languages, used to benchmark abstractive summarization systems== and facilitate research in cross-lingual summarization.

### In-Depth Information

-   **Dataset Composition**:
    -   Over 1 million article-summary pairs.
    -   Sourced from BBC News, leveraging its international presence and content in many languages.
    -   Covers 44 languages, including high-resource, medium-resource, and some relatively low-resource languages.
    -   Provides a rich resource for both monolingual summarization (summarizing an article in language X into a summary in language X) and cross-lingual summarization (e.g., summarizing an English article into a French summary).
-   **Task**: Given a news article (in one of the supported languages), the model must generate an abstractive summary that captures the main points of the article.
-   **Evaluation Metric**:
    -   Commonly evaluated using ROUGE scores (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation), which measure the overlap of n-grams between the generated summary and reference summaries.
    -   Other metrics like BERTScore or MoverScore, and sometimes human evaluations for fluency, coherence, and informativeness, might also be used.
-   **Purpose and Significance**:
    -   **Standardized Multilingual Evaluation**: Provides a consistent benchmark for comparing summarization models across a wide array of languages.
    -   **Supports Low-Resource Summarization**: The inclusion of less-resourced languages encourages the development of techniques that work well with limited data.
    -   **Facilitates Cross-Lingual Research**: Enables study of how well models can transfer summarization abilities across languages or generate summaries in a language different from the source document.
    -   **Promotes Abstractive Summarization**: Encourages models to generate novel phrasing rather than just extracting sentences from the source.
-   **Challenges for Models**:
    -   Understanding the content and nuances of news articles in diverse languages.
    -   Generating fluent, coherent, and concise summaries.
    -   Handling variations in journalistic style across languages.
    -   Performing well on languages with limited training data within the XLSum dataset itself or in pre-training corpora.
    -   Faithfulness: Ensuring the summary accurately reflects the content of the source article without introducing hallucinations.
-   **Performance Trends**:
    -   Pre-trained multilingual sequence-to-sequence models (e.g., mBART, mT5) have shown strong performance on XLSum.
    -   Fine-tuning these models on XLSum data, often with specific strategies for multilingual learning or cross-lingual transfer, is a common approach.
    -   Performance can vary significantly across languages, often correlating with the amount of available data for that language.
