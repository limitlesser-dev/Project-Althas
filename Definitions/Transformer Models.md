# Transformer Models

## Core Concept

**Transformer Models** are a revolutionary type of [[Neural Network]] architecture that has become the foundation for most [[State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Model|state-of-the-art]] results in [[Natural Language Processing|Natural Language Processing (NLP)]] and increasingly in other domains like [[Computer Vision]] and speech processing. Introduced in the 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Google researchers, Transformers rely heavily on a mechanism called **[[Attention Mechanisms|attention]]**, particularly **[[Self-Attention]]**, to ==process sequential data by weighing the importance of different input elements relative to each other, regardless of their distance in the sequence==. This allows for significantly more parallelization than previous sequence models like [[Recurrent Neural Network|RNNs]] and [[LSTM|LSTMs]], enabling the training of much larger models on more extensive datasets.

## In-Depth Information

### Origin: "Attention Is All You Need"

-   The Transformer architecture was first proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017) in their seminal paper, marking a significant departure from traditional sequence-to-sequence models that relied on recurrent or convolutional layers.
-   The core idea was to demonstrate that attention mechanisms alone, without recurrence, are sufficient to achieve excellent performance on tasks like machine translation.

### Core Architecture Components

The original Transformer model consists of two main parts: an **Encoder** and a **Decoder**, each composed of a stack of identical layers.

1.  **[[Transformer Encoder|Encoder]]**:
    *   **Purpose**: To process the input sequence (e.g., a sentence in the source language) and transform it into a rich, continuous representation (a set of context-aware embeddings).
    *   **Each Encoder Layer typically has two main sub-layers**:
        1.  **Multi-Head Self-Attention Mechanism**: Allows each position in the input sequence to attend to all other positions in the input sequence, capturing contextual relationships.
        2.  **Position-wise Fully Connected Feed-Forward Network**: Applied independently to each position, further processing the attended information.
    *   Residual connections and layer normalization are used around each sub-layer.

2.  **[[Transformer Decoder|Decoder]]**:
    *   **Purpose**: To take the encoder's output and the previously generated output tokens to generate the target sequence (e.g., the translated sentence) one token at a time.
    *   **Each Decoder Layer typically has three main sub-layers**:
        1.  **Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention Mechanism**: Similar to the encoder's self-attention, but with a "mask" to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions in the output sequence (ensuring autoregressive property).
        2.  **Encoder-Decoder Attention (Cross-Attention)**: Allows each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the encoder's output, aligning input and output.
        3.  **Position-wise Fully Connected Feed-Forward Network**: Similar to the encoder.
    *   Residual connections and layer normalization are also used.

### Key Mechanisms Explained

1.  **[[Attention Mechanisms|Attention]] & [[Self-Attention]]**:
    *   At its core, attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data.
    *   **[[Self-Attention]]** (or intra-attention) is a specific type of attention where elements within a single sequence relate to each other. It calculates a representation for each token by attending to other tokens in the *same* sequence.
    *   This is achieved by computing **Queries (Q)**, **Keys (K)**, and **Values (V)** vectors for each input token. The attention score between two tokens is calculated based on the dot product of the query of one token and the key of another, which is then scaled and passed through a softmax function to get attention weights. These weights are then used to compute a weighted sum of the value vectors.
    *   Mathematically: $Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V$, where $d_k$ is the dimension of the key vectors.

2.  **Multi-Head Attention**:
    *   Instead of performing a single attention function, Transformers use multiple "attention heads" in parallel.
    *   Each head learns different aspects or subspaces of the attention mechanism. The outputs of these heads are concatenated and linearly transformed.
    *   This allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representational subspaces at different positions.

3.  **[[Positional Encoding]]**:
    *   Since Transformers process tokens in parallel and lack recurrent connections, they don't inherently understand the order or position of tokens in a sequence.
    *   To address this, **positional encodings** (fixed or learned vectors) are added to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. These encodings provide information about the relative or absolute position of tokens.
    *   The original paper used sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:
        $PE_{(pos, 2i)} = sin(pos / 10000^{2i/d_{model}})$
        $PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} = cos(pos / 10000^{2i/d_{model}})$

4.  **Feed-Forward Networks (Position-wise)**:
    *   Each encoder and decoder layer contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. It typically consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.
    *   $FFN(x) = max(0, xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2$

5.  **Residual Connections and Layer Normalization**:
    *   Each sub-layer (self-attention, FFN) in each encoder/decoder layer has a residual connection around it, followed by layer normalization.
    *   These techniques help stabilize the learning process, allow for deeper networks, and mitigate issues like vanishing gradients.

### Advantages Over Previous Architectures (RNNs/LSTMs)

-   **Parallelization**: Unlike RNNs which process sequences token by token sequentially, the self-attention mechanism allows Transformers to process all tokens in a sequence simultaneously, leading to significant speedups in training.
-   **Handling Long-Range Dependencies**: Self-attention can directly model relationships between any two tokens in a sequence, regardless of their distance. This makes it more effective at capturing long-range dependencies compared to RNNs, which can struggle with information propagation over many time steps.
-   **Scalability**: The architecture is highly scalable, allowing for the training of very large models (e.g., [[GPT-4]], [[Google Gemini|Gemini]]) with billions or even trillions of parameters on massive datasets.

### Challenges and Limitations

-   **Quadratic Complexity of Self-Attention**: The computational and memory complexity of self-attention is $O(n^2 \cdot d)$ with respect to sequence length $n$, making it challenging for very long sequences. Various "efficient Transformer" variants have been proposed to address this.
-   **Data Hunger**: Large Transformer models typically require vast amounts of training data to perform well and avoid [[Overfitting]].
-   **Positional Information**: While positional encodings provide sequence order information, the inherent design lacks a direct notion of relative positions compared to RNNs or CNNs.

### Variants and Evolution

The original Transformer architecture has inspired numerous variants and adaptations:

-   **Encoder-Only Models (e.g., [[BERT]], RoBERTa)**: Primarily used for understanding tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. They generate context-rich embeddings for input tokens.
-   **Decoder-Only Models (e.g., [[GPT-4|GPT series]], PaLM, LLaMA)**: Excellent for generative tasks like text generation, language modeling, and dialogue systems. They autoregressively predict the next token.
-   **Encoder-Decoder Models (e.g., original Transformer, T5, BART)**: Suited for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation and summarization.
-   **Vision Transformers ([[Vision Transformer|ViT]])**: Apply the Transformer architecture to image classification by treating image patches as sequences.
-   **Multimodal Transformers (e.g., CLIP, DALL-E)**: Process and relate information from multiple modalities like text and images.

### Applications

Transformer models have revolutionized many fields:

-   **[[Natural Language Processing|NLP]]**: Machine translation, text summarization, question answering, sentiment analysis, text generation, language understanding.
-   **[[Computer Vision]]**: Image classification, object detection, image generation.
-   **Speech Processing**: [[Automatic Speech Recognition|Automatic speech recognition (ASR)]], text-to-speech (TTS).
-   **Biology**: Protein structure prediction (e.g., AlphaFold).
-   **Reinforcement Learning**: Decision making in complex environments.
