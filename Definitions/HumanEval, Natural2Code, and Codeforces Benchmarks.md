# HumanEval, Natural2Code, and Codeforces Benchmarks

This note covers three distinct benchmarks used for evaluating the code generation and understanding capabilities of Large Language Models: **HumanEval**, **Natural2Code (MBPP - Mostly Basic Python Programs)**, and **Codeforces**.

## HumanEval

### Core Concept

**HumanEval** is a benchmark specifically designed by OpenAI to ==evaluate the functional correctness of code generated by [[Large Language Models|Large Language Models (LLMs)]] from natural language descriptions (docstrings)==. It consists of 164 hand-written programming problems with corresponding unit tests. The problems are designed to be relatively simple, solvable by entry-level programmers, and cover a range of programming tasks including string manipulation, list operations, and basic algorithms.

### In-Depth Information

-   **Dataset Composition**:
    -   164 original programming problems.
    -   Each problem includes a function signature, a docstring explaining the task, and several unit tests to verify correctness.
    -   Problems are not sourced from public GitHub repositories to avoid training data contamination.
-   **Task**: Given the function signature and docstring, the LLM's task is to generate the body of the Python function.
-   **Evaluation Metric**:
    -   The primary metric is **pass@k**. This metric measures the percentage of problems for which at least one of *k* generated code samples passes all the unit tests.
    -   For example, pass@1 means a single generated sample must pass; pass@100 means that out of 100 generated samples, at least one must pass.
    -   This metric accounts for the stochastic nature of LLM outputs.
-   **Purpose and Significance**:
    -   **Measures Code Synthesis**: Directly evaluates the model's ability to translate natural language specifications into working code.
    -   **Functional Correctness**: Focuses on whether the generated code actually works as intended, rather than just syntactic correctness or similarity to human code.
    -   **Standardized Evaluation**: Provides a consistent way to compare different code generation models.
    -   **Drives LLM Development for Coding**: Has become a key benchmark for tracking progress in AI-powered code generation (e.g., for models like OpenAI's Codex, GitHub Copilot, GPT-4, Gemini).
-   **Challenges for Models**:
    -   Understanding nuanced natural language descriptions.
    -   Handling edge cases specified or implied in the docstring.
    -   Generating syntactically correct and logically sound code.
    -   Producing efficient code (though efficiency is not the primary evaluation criterion).
-   **Performance Trends**:
    -   Early code generation models had modest performance.
    -   Significant improvements have been seen with larger models and better training techniques.
    -   State-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 have achieved very high pass@1 scores, indicating a strong ability to generate correct solutions for these types of problems on the first attempt.

## Natural2Code (MBPP - Mostly Basic Python Programs)

### Core Concept

**Natural2Code**, more formally known as the **Mostly Basic Python Programs (MBPP)** dataset, is another benchmark for evaluating code generation from natural language. It consists of around 1,000 crowd-sourced Python programming problems. These problems are typically short, entry-level tasks, designed to be solvable with a few lines of code, and are described in natural language.

> Natural2Code (MBPP) is a benchmark that ==evaluates an LLM's ability to generate short Python programs from natural language descriptions, focusing on basic programming tasks==.

### In-Depth Information

-   **Dataset Composition**:
    -   Approximately 974 programming problems.
    -   Each problem consists of:
        -   A natural language description of the task (usually 1-3 sentences).
        -   A function signature (name and parameters).
        -   Three human-written unit tests to verify correctness.
    -   Problems are generally simpler than some found in HumanEval and are focused on common programming constructs.
-   **Task**: Given the natural language description and function signature, the model must generate the Python function body.
-   **Evaluation Metric**:
    -   Similar to HumanEval, **accuracy based on passing unit tests** is the primary metric. Often reported as pass@k.
-   **Purpose and Significance**:
    -   **Complements HumanEval**: Provides another dataset for evaluating code generation, often with slightly different types of problems and descriptions.
    -   **Focus on Basic Proficiency**: Tests fundamental coding skills and understanding of core programming concepts.
    -   **Crowd-Sourced Diversity**: The problems are created by a diverse group of contributors, leading to varied phrasing and task types.
-   **Challenges for Models**:
    -   Interpreting concise natural language descriptions.
    -   Mapping descriptions to appropriate Python constructs.
    -   Ensuring the generated code passes all provided test cases.
-   **Performance Trends**:
    -   Performance on MBPP has also improved significantly with advancements in LLMs.
    -   It is often used alongside HumanEval to provide a more comprehensive picture of a model's code generation capabilities.

## Codeforces

### Core Concept

Using problems from **Codeforces**, a popular competitive programming platform, as a benchmark for LLMs involves ==evaluating models on their ability to solve complex algorithmic problems that typically require sophisticated data structures, algorithms, and intricate problem-solving skills==. Unlike HumanEval or MBPP, Codeforces problems are much more challenging, often requiring non-trivial algorithmic insights and longer, more complex code solutions.

> The Codeforces benchmark assesses an LLM's advanced problem-solving and coding skills by ==challenging it with difficult competitive programming problems that demand deep algorithmic knowledge and creative solution strategies==.

### In-Depth Information

-   **Dataset Composition**:
    -   Problems are sourced from past Codeforces contests.
    -   These problems have varying difficulty levels, often rated within the Codeforces system.
    -   They usually involve a detailed problem statement, input/output specifications, and constraints.
    -   Solutions are judged against a hidden set of test cases on the Codeforces platform or a simulated environment.
-   **Task**: Given a complex algorithmic problem description, the LLM must generate a correct and efficient program (often in C++ or Python) that solves the problem within the given time and memory limits.
-   **Evaluation Metric**:
    -   **Pass Rate**: The percentage of problems solved correctly (i.e., passing all hidden test cases).
    -   Sometimes, partial credit or success on simpler versions of problems is considered.
    -   Efficiency (runtime and memory usage) is also a critical factor, unlike in HumanEval/MBPP where it's secondary.
-   **Purpose and Significance**:
    -   **Tests Deep Algorithmic Reasoning**: Pushes the boundaries of AI capabilities in terms of designing and implementing complex algorithms.
    -   **Simulates Real-World Competitive Programming**: Provides a setting analogous to human competitive programming, requiring not just coding but also algorithmic innovation.
    -   **Highlights Frontiers of AI in Problem Solving**: Success on Codeforces problems is a strong indicator of advanced AI reasoning and problem-solving skills. DeepMind's AlphaCode was a notable early system demonstrating capabilities in this area.
-   **Challenges for Models**:
    -   Deep understanding of complex problem statements and constraints.
    -   Knowledge of advanced algorithms and data structures (e.g., dynamic programming, graph algorithms, number theory).
    -   Ability to devise novel algorithmic solutions or adapt known algorithms to new scenarios.
    -   Generating code that is not only correct but also highly efficient to pass within strict time/memory limits.
    -   Handling complex input/output parsing.
    -   Debugging and refining solutions.
-   **Performance Trends**:
    -   This is an exceptionally challenging domain for LLMs.
    -   Specialized systems like AlphaCode, which might involve generating many candidate solutions, filtering, and testing, have shown promising results, achieving ranks comparable to a significant fraction of human competitors.
    -   General-purpose LLMs still find these problems very difficult, though their capabilities are improving.
    -   Success often requires more than just code generation; it involves a sophisticated search and reasoning process over the space of possible programs.
